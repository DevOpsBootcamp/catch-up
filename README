Catch-Up
========

This script will catch you up to the current lesson. It is recommended to 
read through the slides so you understand exactly what has happened on your 
machine.

To use: 
-------

First, start your VM and ssh into it: 

```
$ cd /path/to/devopsbootcamp-vagrant
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
```

Once you're in your VM (the first part of your prompt will say `vagrant@` rather
than your username on your host machine), run these commands the first time you
use the catch-up script:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/DevOpsBootcamp/catch-up.git
$ cd catch-up
$ ./catch-up.sh <lesson number> # for instance ./catch-up.sh 7
``` 
And then your VM will be up to date with everything! 

If you don't plan to work with the Nobel database and would prefer not to
download it, run the catch-up script like this: 

```
$ ./catch-up.sh <lesson number> m # m for minimal installation
```
